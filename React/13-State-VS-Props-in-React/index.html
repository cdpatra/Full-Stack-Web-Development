      <h2>Difference between State and Props</h2>
      <h3>State</h3>
      <ul>
         <li>State is a local variable of any particular component, it means state is controlled by the component</li>
         <li>State is Mutable</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Props</h3>
      <ul>
         <li>Props are controlled by the parent component</li>
         <li>Props are Immutable (but in React we can change props but it is not good practice)</li>
      </ul>
      <h3 style="color: red">
         But the main similarity between states and props is that whenever either of them gets changed, our component get
         re-rendered
      </h3>
