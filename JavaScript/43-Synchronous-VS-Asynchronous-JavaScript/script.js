// ! <<==============<< Synchronous vs Asynchronous JavaScript >>=================>>

// ! <|---------<< What is thread exactly? Thread in JavaScript >>---------|>
// ^ JavaScript is a single threaded programming language (IMPORTANT POINT)

/* The browserâ€™s web API manages the countdown for setTimeout(), and both the web API and the JavaScript engine execute simultaneously within the main thread. Letâ€™s break it down:

Web API and JavaScript Engine Interaction:
-> When you call setTimeout(callback, delay), the following steps occur:
-> The browserâ€™s web API sets a timer to expire after the specified delay.
-> Meanwhile, the JavaScript engine continues executing other code.
-> The web API and the JavaScript engine operate concurrently within the same main thread.

Event Loop and Callback Queue:
-> The event loop monitors both the call stack (where currently executing functions reside) and the callback queue.
-> When the timer expires, the callback function is placed in the callback queue.

Asynchronous Execution:
-> The event loop ensures that the callback function runs asynchronously:
-> If the call stack is empty (no other code is running), the event loop picks up tasks from the callback queue and executes them.
-> This cooperative multitasking allows the main thread to handle other tasks while waiting for the timer to elapse.

No Separate Threads:
-> Crucially, there is no separate thread for timers or event handling.
-> Everything occurs within the same main thread, maintaining the single-threaded nature of JavaScript execution.

>=> In summary, the browserâ€™s web API and the JavaScript engine work together to manage asynchronous tasks like setTimeout(), ensuring that your code remains responsive even during delays. ðŸ•’ðŸ”— */

   xhr.send();

   xhr.addEventListener(`load`, () => {
      console.log(`after response is received`, xhr);
   });
   // !  since, due to synchronous execution of XMLHttpRequest() our main thread get blocked until our response is received;
